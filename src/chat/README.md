This project uses React and CSS to recreate the Facebook Messenger web application. **THIS IS NOT AN OFFICIAL FACEBOOK PRODUCT**

## Available Components

When using these components it is important to keep in mind that we are utilizing a few different dependencies to achieve a better user experience. Specifically:

- [Moment](https://momentjs.com/) for parsing JavaScript dates and printing them in a readable way.
- [Shave](https://github.com/dollarshaveclub/shave) to trim long messages to maintain consistency amongst `ConversationListItem`.
- [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) to facilitate HTTP requests (for messages, users, etc).
